# Inheritance is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming
# (OOP) that allows a class (called a child or derived class) to inherit
# attributes and methods from another class (called a parent or base class).
# Syntax for Inheritance
# class ParentClass:
#
#
#     # Parent class code here
#
#
#     pass
#
#
# class ChildClass(ParentClass):
#
#
#     # Child class code here
#
#
#     pass


#single in inheritance
class family:
    def person1(self):
        print('monika')

class family2(family):
    def person2(self):
        print('moni')
object=family2()
object.person1()
object.person2()

# multi- level inheritance
class family:
    def person1(self):
        print('monika')

class family2(family):
    def person2(self):
        print('moni')

class family3(family2):
    def person3(self):
        print('nancy')
object=family3()
object.person1()
object.person2()
object.person3()

 # multiple inheritance

class family:
    def person1(self):
        print('monika')

class family2:
    def person2(self):
        print('moni')

class family3(family, family2):
    def person3(self):
        print('nancy')
object=family3()
object.person1()
object.person2()
object.person3()
